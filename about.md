We want to create a simple webapp, running on localhost, that is using the SL-api to display the departures from teh Svedmyra Tunnelbana staion in stockolm. The information displayed should be updated every 1 min. There should also be a refresh button for the user to manually refresh the data. 

The app should display the next 4 depatures towards T-centralen, showing the number of minutus un til the depature as wel as the departure time. 


informtion about the api can be fetched here: https://www.trafiklab.se/api/our-apis/sl/
